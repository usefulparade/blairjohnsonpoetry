            <p><i>A note on “I keep a few dreams of a house to live in later, always later, so much later.”</i> The ones she loved are the ones that never came back. One of the ones she loved said letters written on top of each other could be the concept <i>offensive</i>. She asked if it was their <a href="shedidntgo.html">touching</a>. Was it that? Or the form they made. Was it that? She never recovered her sense of reason. She yelled at the sounds in her sleep. Dusk and crepuscular crying and the dew that wasn’t dew that covered the part of the fruit that wasn’t eaten.</p>
